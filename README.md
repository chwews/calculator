  <img class="simple_calculator" src="images/simple_calculator.png" width="300" height="500">

  <p>
    The Simple Calculator can be used to perform the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication,
    division, modulo and power. It also has the ability to recognize both positive and negative numbers. It
    recognizes parentheses and operations priority. As scientific calculator it can recognize logarithmic and
    trigonometric functions.
